# COVID SIMULATION

A simulation program that models the process of transmitting a virus to a set of individuals through personal contact or contact with infected areas.

## ðŸ“° Desciption

This program simulates the spread of a virus among individuals within different areas. Each person can be in one of the following states: healthy (wearing a GREEN shirt), infected (wearing a RED shirt), or immune (wearing a BLUE shirt). Additionally, people can wear masks for protection.

The virus spreads through personal contact with an infected person or contact with an infected area of the site. The floor color indicates the infection status, with ORANGE representing a newly infected area and YELLOW indicating an area that will stop being infected.
