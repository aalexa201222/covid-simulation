# COVID SIMULATION

A simulation program that models the process of transmitting a virus to a set of individuals through personal contact or contact with infected areas.

## ðŸ“° Desciption

The COVID Simulation project is a Java-based program that simulates the spread of a virus among individuals within different areas. It provides a visual representation of how the virus can be transmitted through personal contact and contact with infected areas. Users can customize the simulation by setting probabilities for virus transmission and specifying the number of people, infected individuals, immune individuals, and area dimensions. The simulation runs for a defined duration, and at the end, it displays the final count of healthy, infected, and immune individuals in each area. The goal of the project is to help understand the dynamics of virus spread and the effectiveness of preventive measures.
